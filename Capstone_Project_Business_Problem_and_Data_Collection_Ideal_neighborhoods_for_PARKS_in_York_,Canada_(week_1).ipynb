As a separate city, it was one of six municipalities that amalgamated in 1998 to form the current city of Toronto.\r\n",

The original York Township was formed in 1793, and it was once called Dublin.\r\n"

There are both GET and POST methods you can use, which means you aren't just limited to reading from feeds, you can also do useful stuff like checking in and creating locations using the API. As for rate limits, your application is limited to 200 requests per hour per method, so you probably want to implement some kind of result caching to \"play nice.\"\r\n",
